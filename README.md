## Assistance

This is a space for receiving and giving assistance with course logistics and content. Ecology has always been about discovery, understanding, and the sharing of information; this course is no different.  Through simple or insightful questions, we will all help one another to learn new material and share that knowledge with others. As such, course participants should feel free to submit a new issue or comment on an existing one [here](https://github.com/QERM514/assistance/issues).
